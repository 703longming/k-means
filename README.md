Implementation of k-means clustering

BRANCH A

Used to complete the following objectives:

A)  Set the number of cluster to two and randomly select two points from the data file
    as two initial means.  Apply K-means algorithm to find the final means of the two 
    clusters and plot the trajectories of the means movement in the clustering process.
